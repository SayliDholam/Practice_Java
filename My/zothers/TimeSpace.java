/*
TIME COMPLEXITY :

A function that gives us the relationship about how the time grows when the input grows.

time complexity != time taken

O(1) < o(logN) < O(N)

always look for worst case complexity

always look at the complexity for large/infinite data

even though value of actual time is different, they are all growing 

we do not care about actual time taken, we care about input-time relation

constants are ignored 

----------------------

BIG O NOTATION : 

it is the upper bound (it cannot exceed beyond this) 

it is the maximum possible

(less than and equal to)

----------------------

BIG OMEGA NOTATION : 

opposite of big O notation

it is the lower bound (it cannot be less than this)

it is the minimum required

(greater than and equal to)

----------------------

BIG THETA NOTATION : 

it is combining both upper and lower bound

big O + big omega = big theta

----------------------

LITTLE O NOTATION : 

it also gives the upper bound but not strict 

(only less than)

----------------------

LITTLE OMEGA NOTATION : 

it also gives the lower bound but its strictly

(only greater than)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPACE COMPLEXITY :

space complexity = input size space + auxiliary space

auxiliary space is the extra space or temporary space used by the algirithm
